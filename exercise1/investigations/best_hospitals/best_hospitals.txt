What hospitals are models of high-quality care?  Which hospitals have the most consistent high scores for a variety of procedures?  To examine which hospital had the best care, I combined the hospital table and the effective care table.  The score in the effective care table gives a score to the hospital for the quality of care they provide.  In order to see which had the best scores across all procedures, I took all the scores and averaged them for each hospital.  This gives me a score assessing the care for all the entries each hospital has.  The results are shown below:
