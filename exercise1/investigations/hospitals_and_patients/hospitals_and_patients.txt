Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

To see if there was a correlation between the effective care score and the survey rated score, I took average scores of each hospital from the effective care table and compared it to the hcahps_base score from the surveys.  In addition, I wanted to compare variability of the hospitals from the effective care table to the hcahps_consist score from the surveys, which rates the consistency.  I compared all these scores to each other to see if there was any combination that would give me a correlation.  The results are as follows:

-0.2183171188739938     -0.19265685336097163    -0.3324141680480153     -0.3555214829795181


The first value is a correlation of the average effective care score and the survey base score.  The second value is a correlation of the average effective care score and they survey consistency score.  The third value is the a correlation of the standard deviation of the effective care score and the survey base score. Finally, the last value is a correlation of the standard deviation of the effective care score and the survey consistency score.

First, we can see that all comparisons are negatively correlated.  This means that the higher the average care score is, the lower the survey base or consistency score. This may be due in part to the fact that the care score is based purely on whether the patient improved or symptoms were taken care of.  However, patient rated survey scores does not necessary rate how well they recover, but also the ambiance and treatment they receive at a hospital.  Bedside manner is important!  In addition, this also means that the more variability there is for a hospital, the lower the patient survey score.  This correlation makes sense as consistency is a valued part of the health care service.  This can also be seen as a much stronger correlation than the effective care scores, with a .33 and .35 correlation value, whereas the the comparisons to the average care score only gave around .20 correlation.  Overall, though the correlation isn't very strong, there do seem to be some trends where large variability causes lower patient survey scores.
