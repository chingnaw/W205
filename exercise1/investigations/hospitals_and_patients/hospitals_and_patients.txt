To see if there was a correlation between the effective care score and the survey rated score, I compared the two values.  No grouping was necessary as we want to see if there was a correlation across all hospitals.  The correlation value returned was:
-0.028148734763740708

This very low value indicates that there is almost no correlation between how well the care is done at a hospital and the patient survey score.  This may be due in part to the fact that the care score is based purely on whether the patient improved or symptoms were taken care of.  However, patient rated survey scores does not necessary rate how well they recover, but also the ambiance and treatment they receive at a hospital.  Bedside manner is important to them.
