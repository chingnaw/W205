To determine which state had the best care, I used the same measurement score that I used in the first question: effective care score.  By averaging the scores across all hospitals within a state, I found the following:
DC      101.0719696969697
MD      100.40634441087613
DE      100.02164502164503
NY      96.82513661202186
NJ      96.40204918032786
NV      95.9890909090909
NH      95.55102040816327
VI      95.45833333333333
CA      95.28648596508151
CT      95.12188099808061
