Write a query which joins weblogs_parquet to user_info and counts the top 5 locations. List the locations.

spark-sql> SELECT
         > u.location,
         > count(u.location) loc_count
         > from
         > user_info u
         > join
         > weblogs_parquet w
         > on w.user_id = u.user_id
         > GROUP BY u.location
         > ORDER BY loc_count DESC
         > LIMIT 5;
